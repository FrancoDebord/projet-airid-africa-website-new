                    <p class="">
                        The African Institute for Research in Infectious Diseases (AIRID) was established in 2021
                        to address the burden of infectious diseases in Africa. It was created through collaboration between
                        local health authorities, international research institutions, and development partners.
                        AIRID strengthens research capacity and fosters partnerships to design and evaluate interventions
                        tailored
                        to African populations. Its work focuses on interdisciplinary research, building local expertise,
                        and translating findings into impactful public health programs.

                    <p class="">
                        AIRID aims to be a leading center of excellence in infectious disease research, recognized for
                        innovative,
                        impactful work that builds local capacity and fosters collaboration. By combining scientific rigor
